## ⏱️ **Time Estimation & Cap System**

### **How Estimated Time Works:**

1. **Route Distance Calculation**
   - Uses Haversine formula for straight-line distance
   - Applies 1.3x multiplier for actual roads
   - Example: 2.0 miles straight line → 2.6 miles actual route

2. **Time Estimation**
   - Average city speed: 25 mph (includes traffic/stops)
   - Driving time = (distance / 25 mph) * 60 minutes
   - Pickup/Dropoff buffer: +10 minutes total
   - **Total Estimated Time** = Driving + Buffer

3. **Time Cap (±10 Minutes)**
   - **Purpose**: Protect customers from unexpected delays, protect drivers from being undercompensated
   - **Maximum Billable**: Estimated time + 10 minutes
   - **Minimum Billable**: Estimated time - 10 minutes

---

## 📊 **Time Cap Examples**

### **Example 1: Normal Delivery**
```
Estimated Time: 30 minutes
Actual Time:    28 minutes
Billable Time:  28 minutes ✓ (within range)
Driver paid for: 28 minutes
```

### **Example 2: Fast Delivery**
```
Estimated Time: 30 minutes
Actual Time:    18 minutes
Billable Time:  20 minutes ✓ (minimum = 30 - 10)
Driver paid for: 20 minutes (driver protected)
```

### **Example 3: Delayed Delivery**
```
Estimated Time: 30 minutes
Actual Time:    45 minutes
Billable Time:  40 minutes ✓ (maximum = 30 + 10)
Driver paid for: 40 minutes (customer protected)
```

### **Example 4: Within Range**
```
Estimated Time: 30 minutes
Actual Time:    35 minutes
Billable Time:  35 minutes ✓ (within range)
Driver paid for: 35 minutes
```

## 🗄️ **Database Schema**

### **New Order Fields:**
```typescript
routeDistanceMiles:        real      // Actual route distance
estimatedDurationMinutes:  integer   // Estimated delivery time
actualDurationMinutes:     integer   // Actual time taken
timeCapMinutes:            integer   // Max billable (estimated + 10)
```

### **Calculation Flow:**
```sql
-- When order is created
INSERT INTO orders (
  route_distance_miles,
  estimated_duration_minutes,
  time_cap_minutes,
  estimated_delivery_time
) VALUES (
  2.6,                           -- Calculated distance
  17,                            -- Estimated time (6 min drive + 10 min buffer)
  27,                            -- Time cap (17 + 10)
  NOW() + INTERVAL '17 minutes'  -- ETA
);

-- When driver completes delivery
UPDATE orders SET
  actual_duration_minutes = EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (actual_delivery_time - driver_accepted_at)) / 60,
  actual_delivery_time = NOW()
WHERE id = 'order_123';
```

## 🎯 **Payment Calculation Logic**

### **Code Implementation:**

```typescript
// shared/paymentCalculator.ts

export interface RouteInfo {
  distance: number;        // miles
  estimatedTime: number;   // minutes
  actualTime?: number;     // actual minutes (optional)
  useTimeCap?: boolean;    // apply ±10 min cap
}

export function calculatePayment(
  routeInfo: RouteInfo,
  itemSize: string,
  numberOfItems: number,
  isRush: boolean,
  tip: number
): PaymentBreakdown {
  
  // Apply time cap if actual time provided
  let billableTime = routeInfo.estimatedTime;
  
  if (routeInfo.useTimeCap && routeInfo.actualTime) {
    const minTime = Math.max(routeInfo.estimatedTime - 10, 0);
    const maxTime = routeInfo.estimatedTime + 10;
    billableTime = Math.min(Math.max(routeInfo.actualTime, minTime), maxTime);
  }
  
  // Customer charges
  const distanceFee = routeInfo.distance * 0.50;
  const timeFee = (billableTime / 60) * 12.00;  // $12/hour
  
  // Driver earnings
  const driverDistancePay = routeInfo.distance * 0.35;  // $0.35/mile
  const driverTimePay = (billableTime / 60) * 8.00;     // $8/hour
  
  // ... rest of calculation
}
```
