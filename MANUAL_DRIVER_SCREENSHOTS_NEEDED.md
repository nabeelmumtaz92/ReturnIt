# 📸 Manual Driver Screenshots Needed

The driver app requires authentication, so I couldn't capture automated screenshots. **You'll need to manually capture these** by logging in as a driver.

## 📝 **Descriptions Already Written:**

Descriptions for each screenshot are in `driver app screenshots/DESCRIPTIONS.md` - just use those when uploading to Play Store!

## 💡 **Tips:**

1. **Use dark mode** if driver app has it (matches the dark theme)
2. **Clear notifications/popups** before screenshot
3. **Use realistic data** if possible (real jobs, earnings)
4. **Check zoom level** is 100% in DevTools
5. **Verify dimensions** match exactly (1080x1920, 1200x1920, 1920x1200)

## 🆘 **Need Help?**

If you can't access driver features:
1. Make sure you're logged in as a driver (not customer)
2. Check if driver account is approved/verified
3. Create test jobs in admin panel if needed

**Once you have all driver screenshots, both apps will be 100% ready for Play Store submission!** 📱✨
