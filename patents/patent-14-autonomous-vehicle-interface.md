## Title

*System and Interface for Autonomous Vehicle Pickup and Return Operations in Customer-Originated Logistics Networks*

---

## Abstract

An integrated control and communication system for coordinating autonomous vehicles that perform consumer-initiated pickups and returns. The platform receives pickup requests from customers, assigns them to self-driving vehicles based on proximity and cargo capacity, and verifies completion using onboard cameras and sensors. The interface allows real-time supervision, rerouting, and safety overrides by human operators.

---

## Summary

The invention extends Return It's customer-first model into autonomous logistics. When a pickup request is received, the system communicates with nearby autonomous vehicles, transmits navigation data, and monitors completion through vehicle telemetry. It enables mixed human-autonomous fleets managed under one software layer.

### Key Components

1. **Autonomous Vehicle Assignment Engine**: Evaluates pickup requests and assigns to nearest self-driving vehicle based on proximity, cargo capacity, and current route
2. **Vehicle Communication Protocol**: Transmits navigation data, pickup instructions, and customer details to autonomous vehicles
3. **Completion Verification System**: Monitors pickup completion via onboard cameras and sensors (weight, dimensions, QR code scanning)
4. **Human Oversight Interface**: Provides real-time supervision, rerouting capabilities, and safety override functions for operators
5. **Mixed Fleet Management**: Coordinates both human drivers and autonomous vehicles under unified dispatch system

### Technical Innovation

- Seamless integration with existing Return It platform
- Real-time telemetry monitoring and completion verification
- Safety-first design with human override capabilities
- Scalable architecture supporting multiple autonomous vehicle types (cars, robots)

## Example Claims

1. A computer-implemented interface that receives consumer pickup requests and transmits them to autonomous vehicles for execution.

2. The interface of claim 1, comprising remote monitoring and human-override functions.

3. The system of claim 1, wherein onboard sensors capture verification data and transmit it to a central return database.

4. The system of claim 1, compatible with both self-driving cars and small robotic units.

5. The system of claim 1, wherein vehicle assignment considers proximity, cargo capacity, and current route optimization.

6. The interface of claim 2, providing real-time telemetry dashboards for human operators to monitor fleet status.
