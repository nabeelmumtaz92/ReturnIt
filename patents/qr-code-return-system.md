# Patent Application: QR Code-Based Return Initialization System
**Application Date**: October 2, 2025  
**Inventors**: ReturnIt Platform Team  
**Title**: System and Method for Automated Return Processing via Dynamic QR Codes

## ABSTRACT

A novel system for initiating product returns using dynamically generated QR codes that encode customer, product, and retailer information. The system enables customers to scan a QR code to automatically populate return booking forms, eliminating manual data entry while maintaining compatibility with traditional manual entry workflows.

## INVENTION SUMMARY

### Core Innovation

A QR code generation and scanning system that:

1. **Dynamic QR Generation**: Retailers generate unique QR codes encoding:
   - Customer identification data
   - Product information (SKU, description, purchase date)
   - Return authorization details
   - Retailer location preferences
   - Special handling instructions

2. **Seamless Form Population**: Customer scans QR code → mobile app/website automatically fills booking form with encoded data → customer reviews and confirms → return created

3. **Hybrid Workflow**: System maintains existing manual entry option alongside QR scanning, ensuring accessibility for all user types

4. **Security Features**:
   - Time-limited QR codes with expiration
   - One-time use tokens to prevent duplicate returns
   - Encrypted data payloads with HMAC verification
   - Audit trail for all QR scans

### Novel Features

1. **Retailer POS Integration**: QR codes generated at point of sale during original purchase, printed on receipts

2. **Email/SMS Delivery**: QR codes sent to customers via email or SMS for online purchases

3. **Multi-Format Support**: 
   - Static QR for general return initiation
   - Dynamic QR with pre-filled customer/order data
   - Batch QR generation for in-store kiosks

4. **Progressive Enhancement**: QR scan provides data but allows customer modification before submission

5. **Analytics Tracking**: System tracks QR usage rates, scan locations, time-to-scan metrics for optimization

## CLAIMS

### Claim 1 (Independent)
A computerized system for processing product returns, comprising:
- A QR code generation module that creates unique QR codes encoding customer and product return data
- A mobile scanning interface that decodes QR codes and extracts return information
- A form population module that automatically fills return booking fields with extracted data
- A validation module that verifies QR code authenticity and prevents reuse
- A hybrid input system that allows both QR-based and manual data entry

### Claim 2 (Dependent on Claim 1)
The system of Claim 1, wherein QR codes include expiration timestamps and are invalidated after successful use.

### Claim 3 (Dependent on Claim 1)
The system of Claim 1, wherein QR code payloads are encrypted and include HMAC signatures for verification.

### Claim 4 (Independent)
A method for initiating product returns, comprising:
- Generating a QR code at point of sale encoding customer and product information
- Providing the QR code to the customer via receipt, email, or SMS
- Receiving a QR scan request from customer mobile device
- Decoding the QR code and extracting return data
- Automatically populating a return booking form with extracted data
- Allowing customer review and modification of populated data
- Creating a return order upon customer confirmation

## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### QR Code Payload Structure
```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "type": "return_authorization",
  "expires_at": "2025-10-15T23:59:59Z",
  "token": "unique_one_time_token",
  "customer": {
    "email": "customer@example.com",
    "phone": "+1234567890",
    "name": "John Doe"
  },
  "order": {
    "external_id": "ORDER-12345",
    "purchase_date": "2025-09-15",
    "retailer": "Best Buy",
    "location": "Store #1234 - St. Louis, MO"
  },
  "item": {
    "sku": "ELEC-TV-55-001",
    "description": "55\" 4K Smart TV",
    "category": "Electronics",
    "value": 599.99
  },
  "signature": "hmac_sha256_signature"
}
```

### Security Flow
```
Generate QR → Sign with HMAC → Encode → Print/Send
                                              ↓
Customer Receives → Scans QR → Decode → Verify HMAC
                                              ↓
Check Expiration → Validate Token → Populate Form
                                              ↓
Customer Confirms → Mark Token Used → Create Return
```

## COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES

1. **User Experience**: Reduces return initiation time from 5+ minutes to <30 seconds
2. **Error Reduction**: Eliminates typos and data entry mistakes
3. **Retailer Efficiency**: Pre-validated data reduces processing time
4. **Omnichannel**: Works for in-store purchases, online orders, phone orders
5. **Accessibility**: Maintains manual entry option for non-smartphone users

## MARKET APPLICATION

**Use Cases**:
- Electronics retailers: High-value item returns with complex SKUs
- Fashion retailers: Size/color exchanges
- Department stores: Receipt-based return authorization
- Online retailers: Email-based return initiation

**Integration Points**:
- POS systems (NCR, Square, Clover)
- E-commerce platforms (Shopify, Magento, WooCommerce)
- Email marketing systems (SendGrid, Mailchimp)
- SMS gateways (Twilio, MessageBird)

## CONCLUSION

This QR code system eliminates friction in the return process while maintaining flexibility for all customer types. The combination of automated form population, security features, and hybrid workflows creates a novel approach to return initiation.
