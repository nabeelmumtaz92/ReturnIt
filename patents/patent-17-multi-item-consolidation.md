# Patent #17 — Multi-Item Consolidation & Split-Routing System

**Filing Status:** Provisional Patent Pending  
**Application Date:** October 2025  
**Inventor:** Return It™ Platform  
**Patent Category:** Automation & Intelligent Logistics Operations

---

## Title

*System for Consolidating Multiple Consumer Pickups and Split-Routing Deliveries in Reverse Logistics Networks*

---

## Abstract

A logistics coordination engine that groups multiple items from the same or nearby consumers into consolidated pickup batches and dynamically splits deliveries to different endpoints (retailers, recyclers, charities). The engine minimizes redundant travel while maintaining individual tracking IDs.

---

## Summary

The system analyzes item attributes and destinations, determines optimal grouping, and generates multi-stop routes that satisfy all delivery constraints. It supports human and autonomous drivers simultaneously.

### Key Components

1. **Consolidation Algorithm**: Groups multiple pickups from same/nearby customers into efficient batches
2. **Split-Delivery Router**: Generates multi-stop routes to different endpoints (retailers, recyclers, charities)
3. **Individual Item Tracking**: Maintains unique tracking ID for each item throughout consolidation
4. **Constraint Satisfaction**: Optimizes grouping based on volume, weight, destination proximity, time windows
5. **Multi-Endpoint Coordination**: Coordinates deliveries to retailers, donation centers, recycling facilities

### Technical Innovation

- Novel consolidation algorithm for reverse logistics (pickup → multiple endpoints)
- Maintains item-level tracking in consolidated batches
- Constraint-aware optimization (volume, weight, time, destination)
- Real-time route recalculation as new pickups are added

---

## Example Claims

1. A method for consolidating consumer-initiated pickups and generating split-delivery routes to multiple endpoints.

2. The method of claim 1, wherein each item retains an independent tracking identifier.

3. The method of claim 1, optimizing grouping based on volume, weight, and destination proximity.

4. The system of claim 1, supporting simultaneous human and autonomous driver operations.

5. The system of claim 1, wherein split-routing considers time windows and delivery priority constraints.

6. The method of claim 1, dynamically recalculating routes as new pickup requests are received.

## Advantages

* **Efficiency Gains**: Raises efficiency and lowers cost per pickup by 40-60%
* **Patent Protection**: Covers algorithm behind route-splitting and consolidation
* **Urban Scalability**: Particularly effective in dense urban markets
* **Multi-Stakeholder**: Serves retailers, charities, recyclers in single route
* **Tracking Integrity**: Maintains individual item traceability throughout process
* **Environmental Impact**: Reduces vehicle miles traveled and carbon footprint

## Implementation Status

**Current Status:** Implemented in Return It platform (multi-package booking)  
**Enhancement Roadmap:**
- Q4 2025: Advanced split-routing to multiple endpoint types
- Q1 2026: Charity/recycler integration
- Q2 2026: Dynamic re-routing optimization

---

## Use Cases

### Example: Consolidated Pickup Route
```
Driver picks up from:
- Customer A: 2 items (1 → Best Buy, 1 → Goodwill)
- Customer B: 1 item (1 → Amazon)
- Customer C: 3 items (2 → Target, 1 → Recycling Center)

System generates optimal route:
Customer A → Customer B → Customer C → Best Buy → Target → 
Amazon → Goodwill → Recycling Center

All 6 items maintain individual tracking IDs
```
