# Patent #19 — Blockchain-Based Return Provenance System

**Filing Status:** Provisional Patent Pending  
**Application Date:** October 2025  
**Inventor:** Return It™ Platform  
**Patent Category:** FinTech + Blockchain + Retail Integration

## Title

*Immutable Blockchain Ledger System for Tracking Product Return Authenticity and Chain of Custody*

---

## Abstract

A blockchain-based provenance system that creates an immutable, cryptographically-secured record of every return transaction. Each pickup, transfer, and delivery is recorded as a blockchain transaction, creating a tamper-proof audit trail for retailers, consumers, and regulatory bodies. The system prevents fraud, validates authenticity, and provides complete chain-of-custody documentation.

---

## Summary

Traditional return systems lack verifiable proof of handling and authenticity. This invention leverages distributed ledger technology to create an unalterable record of return events. Each transaction includes timestamp, GPS coordinates, photo verification, and digital signatures from all parties involved.

### Key Components

1. **Distributed Ledger Integration**: Blockchain network (Ethereum, Polygon, or private chain) for transaction recording
2. **Smart Contract System**: Automated validation and payment release based on blockchain-verified completion
3. **Cryptographic Signing**: Digital signatures from customer, driver, and retailer at each handoff
4. **Tamper-Proof Photo Storage**: IPFS integration for decentralized image verification
5. **Multi-Party Verification**: Requires consensus from multiple parties before transaction finalization

### Technical Innovation

- First reverse logistics platform with blockchain provenance
- Prevents return fraud through immutable audit trail
- Smart contract automation for instant payment settlements
- Regulatory compliance through cryptographic proof
- Decentralized storage for verification media

## Example Claims

1. A method for recording return logistics transactions on a distributed blockchain ledger, wherein each transaction includes cryptographic signatures from multiple parties.

2. The system of claim 1, utilizing smart contracts to automate payment release upon blockchain-verified completion.

3. The system of claim 1, storing verification media (photos, signatures) on decentralized IPFS storage with blockchain hash references.

4. The method of claim 1, wherein GPS coordinates and timestamps are cryptographically bound to each transaction for location verification.

5. The system of claim 1, enabling regulatory audits through immutable chain-of-custody documentation.

6. The method of claim 2, wherein smart contracts automatically release driver payments and retailer credits upon multi-party transaction confirmation.

## Advantages

* **Fraud Prevention**: Immutable records prevent return fraud and counterfeiting
* **Instant Settlements**: Smart contracts enable automatic payment processing
* **Regulatory Compliance**: Cryptographic proof satisfies audit requirements
* **Consumer Trust**: Transparent tracking builds confidence in return process
* **Retailer Protection**: Verifiable proof of return condition and handling
* **First-Mover Advantage**: Only blockchain-based reverse logistics platform
