## Refund Flow Architecture

### Traditional Return (7-14 days)
```
Customer ships return → Retailer receives → Manual inspection → 
Refund approval → Payment processing → Customer receives refund
```

### Return It Instant Refund (5 minutes)
```
Driver pickup → Photo verification → AI fraud check → 
Instant refund issued → Item in transit → Retailer receives → 
Escrow reconciliation → Settlement complete
```

## Fraud Detection Variables

### Customer Risk Factors
- Return frequency (multiple returns per week = high risk)
- Account age (new accounts = moderate risk)
- Return-to-purchase ratio (>50% = high risk)
- Item value escalation (suddenly returning expensive items = high risk)
- Address changes (different addresses = moderate risk)

### Item Risk Factors
- High-value electronics (>$500)
- Serial number verification
- Condition discrepancy from photos
- Category trends (AirPods, designer clothes = higher fraud)

### Behavioral Patterns
- Return timing (same day as delivery = moderate risk)
- Multiple accounts from same IP
- Coordinated returns (same items, similar timing)
- Communication anomalies
