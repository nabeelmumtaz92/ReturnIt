# Patent Application: Real-Time Webhook Notification System for Logistics Events
**Application Date**: October 2, 2025  
**Inventors**: ReturnIt Platform Team  
**Title**: System and Method for Event-Driven Status Notifications in Reverse Logistics

## ABSTRACT

A webhook-based notification system that delivers real-time status updates to retailer systems as returns progress through the logistics pipeline. The system includes intelligent retry logic, failure monitoring, signature verification, and delivery tracking, enabling retailers to maintain synchronized order states across their systems.

## INVENTION SUMMARY

### Core Innovation

An event-driven webhook system comprising:

1. **Event Subscription Management**:
   - Retailers configure which events to receive (return.created, return.picked_up, return.delivered, etc.)
   - Multiple webhook endpoints per retailer for redundancy
   - Event filtering and routing logic

2. **Secure Delivery Protocol**:
   - HMAC-SHA256 signature generation using shared secrets
   - Request timeout configuration per endpoint
   - Delivery attempt tracking and logging

3. **Intelligent Retry System**:
   - Exponential backoff algorithm (2x, 4x, 8x delays)
   - Configurable max retry attempts (default: 3)
   - Consecutive failure tracking with auto-disable
   - Manual retry triggers for failed deliveries

4. **Health Monitoring**:
   - Last success/failure timestamps
   - Success rate calculations
   - Alert thresholds for degraded performance
   - Automatic endpoint deactivation after N consecutive failures

### Novel Features

1. **Bi-Directional Verification**: Retailers can verify webhook authenticity by validating HMAC signatures

2. **Delivery Audit Trail**: Complete record of all webhook attempts including:
   - Request payload and headers
   - Response status and body
   - Attempt number and timing
   - Failure reasons and next retry schedule

3. **Event Replay**: Failed deliveries can be manually replayed after fixing endpoint issues

4. **Webhook Testing**: Test endpoint functionality before enabling live traffic

5. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent webhook storms by limiting delivery frequency

## CLAIMS

### Claim 1 (Independent)
A computerized system for delivering logistics event notifications, comprising:
- An event capture module that detects order status changes
- A subscription management module that maintains retailer webhook configurations
- A signature generation module that creates HMAC signatures for payload verification
- A delivery module that transmits webhook payloads to registered endpoints
- A retry module that implements exponential backoff for failed deliveries
- A monitoring module that tracks delivery success rates and disables unhealthy endpoints

### Claim 2 (Dependent on Claim 1)
The system of Claim 1, wherein the retry module implements exponential backoff with configurable multipliers and maximum attempts.

### Claim 3 (Dependent on Claim 1)
The system of Claim 1, wherein webhook payloads include HMAC-SHA256 signatures generated using retailer-specific secrets.

### Claim 4 (Independent)
A method for notifying external systems of logistics events, comprising:
- Detecting an order status change event
- Retrieving all active webhook subscriptions for the associated retailer
- Generating an HMAC signature for the event payload
- Transmitting the signed payload to each subscribed endpoint
- Recording delivery attempts and response codes
- Implementing exponential backoff retry for failed deliveries
- Disabling endpoints after exceeding consecutive failure thresholds

## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Webhook Payload Format
```json
{
  "event": "return.picked_up",
  "data": {
    "order": {
      "id": "ret_abc123",
      "tracking_number": "RET20251002ABC",
      "status": "picked_up",
      "customer_name": "John Doe",
      "pickup_address": "123 Main St, St. Louis, MO",
      "retailer": "Best Buy",
      "driver_id": 42,
      "pickup_eta": "2025-10-02T14:30:00Z"
    },
    "timestamp": "2025-10-02T14:25:33Z",
    "webhook_id": "whk_xyz789"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "merchant_id": "best_buy_stl",
    "environment": "production",
    "api_version": "1.0"
  }
}
```

### HTTP Headers
```
POST /webhooks/returnit HTTP/1.1
Host: retailer.example.com
Content-Type: application/json
X-ReturnIt-Signature: sha256=abc123def456...
X-ReturnIt-Event: return.picked_up
X-ReturnIt-Webhook-ID: whk_xyz789
X-ReturnIt-Timestamp: 1696258533
```

### Retry Logic Algorithm
```
Attempt 1: Immediate
Attempt 2: +2 minutes (backoff_multiplier^1)
Attempt 3: +4 minutes (backoff_multiplier^2)
Attempt 4: +8 minutes (backoff_multiplier^3)

After max_retries exceeded → Mark as failed
After 5 consecutive failures → Disable endpoint
```

## COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES

1. **Real-Time Sync**: Retailers maintain up-to-date order states
2. **Reliability**: Automatic retries prevent data loss
3. **Security**: HMAC signatures prevent spoofing attacks
4. **Observability**: Complete audit trail for debugging
5. **Self-Healing**: Automatic endpoint health management

## MARKET APPLICATION

**Integration Types**:
- Inventory management systems
- Customer service platforms
- Shipping/tracking systems
- Analytics dashboards
- Email/SMS notification systems

**Event Types**:
- return.created
- return.assigned (driver assigned)
- return.picked_up
- return.in_transit
- return.delivered
- return.completed
- return.cancelled
- return.failed (delivery refused)

## CONCLUSION

This webhook system enables real-time synchronization between ReturnIt and retailer systems, creating a tightly integrated ecosystem. The combination of intelligent retry logic, security features, and health monitoring represents a robust approach to event-driven notifications.
