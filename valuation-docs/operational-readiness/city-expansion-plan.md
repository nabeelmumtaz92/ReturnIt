## üîÑ **Expansion Funding Requirements**

### **Capital Needs by Phase**

---

## üí° **Key Expansion Insights**

### **Why This Plan Works**

1. **Progressive Validation**: Start small (St. Louis), prove model, then scale
2. **Regional Clustering**: Build density before jumping across country
3. **Capital Efficiency**: Each city self-funds after Month 6
4. **Operational Learning**: Extract playbook from early cities, replicate

### **Risk Mitigation**

1. **Slower Growth Option**: If funding limited, expand 2-3 cities/year (vs. 7-15)
2. **Cherry-Pick Markets**: Focus on top 25 cities only (Year 5 target = 25 vs. 50)
3. **Franchise Model**: License technology to local operators (capital-light)
