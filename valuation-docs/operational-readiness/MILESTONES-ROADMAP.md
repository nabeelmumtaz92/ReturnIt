4. Emphasize specialized returns expertise in marketing

### **Financial Risk: Burn Rate Exceeds Projections**

**Action**:
1. Pause new city launches
2. Reduce marketing spend by 30%
3. Implement driver performance-based pay (reduce guaranteed minimums)
4. Bridge financing from existing investors

### **Operational Risk: Driver Shortage**
**Trigger**: <2:1 driver:order ratio in any city  
**Action**:
