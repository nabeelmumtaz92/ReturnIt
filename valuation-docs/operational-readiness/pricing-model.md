### **2. Distance Fee** (Variable)
**Rate**: $0.50 per mile  
**Calculation**: Straight-line distance from pickup address to store  
**Cap**: $10 maximum (20 miles)

**Examples**:
- 2 miles: $1.00
- 5 miles: $2.50

### **5. Multi-Item Fee** (Per Additional Item)
**Rate**: $1.00 per item after the first  
**Example**: 3 items = base + $2.00 (items 2 and 3)

Size:         $2.00 (Large)

```

---

### **7. Small Order Fee** (Conditional)
**Amount**: $2.00  
**Condition**: Applied if subtotal < $8.00

- Encourages customers to combine items

---

### **8. Rush Fee** (Optional)
