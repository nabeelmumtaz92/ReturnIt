### **Anticipated Questions & Answers**

**Q: Why hasn't UPS/FedEx done this?**  
A: They're focused on B2B logistics. We're consumer-first with gig drivers (capital-light). Plus, our patent portfolio creates barriers.

**Q: What's your competitive advantage if DoorDash enters?**  
A: (1) 65 patents ($6.5M-13M value), (2) return-specific features (policy validation, store integration), (3) 2-3 year head start, (4) better driver economics (70% vs 60%).

**Q: How do you ensure profitability?**  
A: Unit economics are positive from Day 1 (32% margin). Variable costs scale linearly. Break-even at ~6,500 orders/quarter (achievable Month 6).

**Q: What if customers don't adopt?**  
A: (1) Low pricing ($3.99 vs. $8 UPS), (2) Superior convenience (doorstep vs. drive to store), (3) Market validation: Happy Returns sold for $150M (worse UX than us).

**Q: Driver retention risk?**  
A: (1) 70% split (vs. 60% DoorDash), (2) 100% of tips, (3) Less driving (returns local), (4) Cleaner work (no food handling).
