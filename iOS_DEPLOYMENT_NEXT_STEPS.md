# üçé iOS Deployment - What Happens After You Pay $99

## Immediate Next Steps (Once Apple Approves Your Account)

### Step 1: Login to Expo Account
When your Apple Developer account is approved, I'll need you to:
```bash
# You'll run this command to login
expo login
```
Then provide me access to run the builds.

### Step 2: I Run the Automated Build
```bash
cd mobile-driver-app
./build-deploy.sh
```

This will:
- Configure iOS bundle identifier (com.returnly.driver)
- Connect to your Apple Developer account
- Generate distribution certificates automatically
- Build the iOS app file (.ipa)
- Provide download link in 10-15 minutes

### Step 3: Upload to App Store Connect
You'll get a download link for the .ipa file, then:
1. Go to appstoreconnect.apple.com
2. Create new app: "Returnly Driver"
3. Upload the .ipa file
4. Fill in app description (I'll provide this)
5. Submit for review
