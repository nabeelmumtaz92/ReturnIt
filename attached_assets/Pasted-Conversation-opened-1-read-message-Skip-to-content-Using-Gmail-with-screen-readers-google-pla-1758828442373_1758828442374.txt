To bring your app into compliance, follow these steps:

Go to Store listings and check your default store listing and any custom store listings, including any translated store listings to make sure that the information and screenshots you have provided match all the functionality and features of your app.

We recommend using test tracks to thoroughly test the quality and functionality of your app with users, capture valuable feedback, and identify bugs before attempting another review.

About the Misleading Claims policy
We donâ€™t allow apps that contain false or misleading information or claims, including in the description, title, icon, and screenshots, such as apps that are improperly categorized, including but not limited to, the app rating or app category.

Before you send your app for review, make sure that it complies with all Developer Program policies. If you repeatedly violate our policies, you may be prevented from publishing updates to your app, or your app may be suspended.
