Perfect — that’s the right call. If you want to **test your app on a real iPhone** (not just Expo Go or a PWA) **before publishing to the App Store**, here are all your options — ranging from *quick & free* to *fully production-ready*.

---

## 🚀 1. **Xcode local build & test on your own iPhone (free or paid)**

This is the most direct and reliable way.

### ✅ What you need

* A Mac (or Mac cloud VM like MacStadium, MacInCloud, etc.)
* Xcode installed
* An Apple ID (free is enough for limited testing; paid Developer Program unlocks more)

### 🧩 Steps

1. Plug in your iPhone → open your project in Xcode
2. In the top bar, choose your device from the “build target” dropdown
3. Go to **Signing & Capabilities** → select your Apple ID under *Team*
4. Press **Run ▶️** — Xcode builds and installs the app directly onto your phone

**Free account limits:**

* The app expires after **7 days** and must be rebuilt
* You can’t distribute it to others
  **Paid Developer account ($99/year):**
* Permanent provisioning profiles
* Up to 100 test devices
* Can share builds with others (see next option)

## 🧪 2. **TestFlight (official Apple beta distribution)**

The **cleanest way to test on real devices** before App Store release.

### 🛠 Requirements

* Enroll in the Apple Developer Program
* Upload your build (.ipa) from Xcode or CI/CD to **App Store Connect → TestFlight**

### 🧾 Workflow

1. Archive your app in Xcode → “Distribute App” → App Store Connect → “Upload”
2. In App Store Connect, go to *My Apps › Your App › TestFlight*
3. Add testers by email or share a public link

TestFlight lets you:

* Add up to **10,000 testers**
* Run staged beta versions before official release
* Collect feedback/crash reports automatically

💡 *For Return It, this is ideal for testing your driver app internally before launch.*

## 🔧 3. **Ad Hoc distribution (manual device installs)**

For private beta testing **without TestFlight**.

### ⚙️ How it works

* Register device UDIDs in Apple Developer portal
* Create an “Ad Hoc” provisioning profile
* Build your app with that profile
* Send the `.ipa` file to testers (via email, Diawi, or your own server)

**Limit:** 100 devices per year.
**Use case:** Early driver or internal builds before TestFlight setup.

## 🏗 4. **Third-party build/distribution tools (no Expo Go or EAS)**

### Examples

* **Fastlane** → automates Xcode builds, signing, and TestFlight uploads
* **Bitrise / Codemagic / App Center / CI/CD GitHub Actions** → build `.ipa` from source, sign, and send to TestFlight or direct download
* Works perfectly with a **bare React Native app** or **Swift** codebase

You’ll need:

* An Apple Developer account
* Certificates & provisioning profiles configured in CI

💡 Combine this with **GitHub Actions** so every push to `main` builds a new `.ipa` for testing.

## 🧱 5. **Bare React Native workflow (skip Expo Go, keep native control)**

If your app started with Expo Go but you want real device builds:

1. Run `npx expo prebuild` → converts managed Expo project into a bare React Native app with iOS and Android folders
2. Open `ios/` in Xcode
3. Build & run directly on your device or push to TestFlight

This gives you **full access to native iOS APIs**, works with **Stripe SDKs**, **background location**, etc.—perfect for your driver logistics use case.

If you want, I can generate a **ready-to-use “Bare React Native → Xcode → TestFlight” setup guide** specifically tailored for your Return It app (with all commands, directory setup, signing instructions, and TestFlight steps).
Would you like me to create that next?
