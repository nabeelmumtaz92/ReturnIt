Good â€” **ZIP code analytics** are critical for scaling ReturnIt. You want to measure both **supply (drivers)** and **demand (customers/orders)** so you can make smart decisions on pricing, staffing, and marketing.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the **key metrics per ZIP code** you should track:

âœ… **Recommendation for ReturnIt MVP Analytics:**
Start with the **demand + supply metrics** (orders, active drivers, pickup times) â€” these will show if you have product-market fit in each ZIP. Then layer on financial and expansion insights as volume grows.

Would you like me to design a **ReturnIt ZIP Analytics Dashboard mockup** (what charts + tables to display for ops) so you can see how this data would look in the admin panel?
