Perfect — that’s the right way to do this.
To make the **Return It Driver Training Manual v1.1** fully accurate for *your* app (and not just modeled after others), I’ll need specific in-app details so I can describe exactly how your drivers will see and use it.

Here’s the full list — divided into short sections you can fill in or screenshot from your app / admin dashboard 👇

---

## 🧭 **A. App Structure**

1. What are the **main tabs or screens** in your Driver app?
   (Example: *Home, Active Orders, Earnings, Profile, Support*, etc.)
2. When drivers tap an order — what details are shown?
   (Pickup time, customer name, distance, payout, barcode, etc.)
3. Are there **different order types or tiers** (Standard, Priority, Instant)?

   * If yes, what do they mean in your system?

---

## 📦 **B. Order Flow**

1. How does a driver **receive** a new order?

   * Push notification? Auto-accept radius?
2. What steps do they complete during pickup?

   * Scan label? Take photo? Signature?
3. How do they mark an order as **complete**?

   * Drop-off receipt upload? Photo proof? Button label?
4. Are **returns, donations, and exchanges** handled differently in the UI?

   * If yes, describe or show screenshots of each type.

## 💵 **C. Payouts**

1. What’s the **default payout split** (still 70/30)?
2. What options exist for payouts?

   * Instant / weekly / daily?
3. What’s the **payout provider** (Stripe Connect, PayPal, etc.)?
4. Do drivers see **tips or bonuses** in the app?

---

## 🧰 **D. Tools & Features**

1. Is there **in-app navigation** or do they open Google/Apple Maps?
2. Is there a **chat** or **call** feature with customers?
3. What do you use for **support** (chat bot, email, ticket form)?
4. Are there any **unique features** (e.g., “return locker mode,” “scan receipt,” “QR drop,” “upload label,” etc.)?

---

## 🧑‍💼 **E. Driver Requirements & Conduct**

1. Any **vehicle rules** (car size, condition, uniforms, etc.)?
2. Do you have a **specific pickup radius or service area** (St. Louis zones)?
3. Are there **bonuses or promotions** (e.g., “Complete 10 orders = +$20”)?

---

## 🆘 **F. Communications & Support**

1. Confirm your **driver support email** and **emergency number**.
2. Do you plan a **broadcast message system** for driver alerts (e.g., weather updates, high-demand zones)?

Once you send me those details (you can just number them in order or paste screenshots),
I’ll build the **Return It Driver Manual v1.1 — App-Specific Edition**, ready for:

* Print (PDF)
* In-app “Help” section
* Web onboarding (Notion or portal)

Would you like me to create a short **fillable template** you can type into for these answers? (that way you can fill it once and use it again later for version updates).
