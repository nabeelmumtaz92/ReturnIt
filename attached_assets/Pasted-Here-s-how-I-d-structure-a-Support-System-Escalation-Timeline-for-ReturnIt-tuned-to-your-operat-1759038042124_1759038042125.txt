Here‚Äôs how I‚Äôd structure a **Support System Escalation Timeline** for ReturnIt, tuned to your operations:

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Escalation Timeline

### 1. **Critical Tickets (Immediate Ops Impact)**

Examples: Driver stuck with customer‚Äôs package, store refusing package, payment failures.

* **Initial Response:** within **15 minutes** (live chat/phone ideally).
* **Escalation to Tier 2:** if not resolved in **1 hour**.
* **Resolution Target:** **<4 hours**.

---

### 2. **High Priority (Affects Experience but Not Urgent)**

Examples: Order delays, app crashes, driver no-show.

* **Initial Response:** within **1 hour**.
* **Escalation to Tier 2:** if not resolved in **4 hours**.
* **Resolution Target:** **24 hours**.

---

### 3. **Standard / Low Priority (General Questions, Minor Issues)**

Examples: Refund requests, policy clarifications, profile edits.

* **Initial Response:** within **24 hours**.
* **Escalation to Tier 2:** if not resolved in **72 hours**.
* **Resolution Target:** **3‚Äì5 business days**.

## üîß Support Tool Integration Options

* **Helpdesk / Ticketing:**

  * **Zendesk** ‚Üí powerful but pricey.
  * **Freshdesk** ‚Üí affordable, good automation.
  * **Zoho Desk** ‚Üí budget-friendly, integrates with Zoho ecosystem.

* **Chat / Messaging:**

  * **Intercom** ‚Üí great in-app chat + bots.
  * **Twilio SMS/WhatsApp** ‚Üí driver + customer support via text.
  * **Slack Integration** ‚Üí internal ops escalation.

* **Knowledge Base / Self-Service:**

  * Zendesk Guide, Freshdesk KB, or custom FAQ page inside the app.

---

‚úÖ **Recommendation for ReturnIt MVP:**

* Start with **Freshdesk (tickets + email + chat)** ‚Üí cost-effective.
* Add **Twilio SMS support** for drivers (many prefer text).
* Escalation: **15 min ‚Üí 1 hr ‚Üí 24 hrs** depending on severity.

Would you like me to design a **Support Escalation Flowchart** (visual of ticket creation ‚Üí assignment ‚Üí escalation) so you can drop it into your ops manual?
