Nice — this is the right mindset. You’ve already built the hard part (real-time dispatch). From here, “making life easier” means **removing friction** for everyone involved — *drivers, customers, merchants, and you (the admin)* — through automation, visibility, and smart defaults.

Here’s a straight-talk list of everything that genuinely makes day-to-day Return It operations easier 👇

### 🪄 Quick Wins You Can Add Next Week

1. Add a **“toast” notification component** to the admin panel.
2. Integrate **Stripe Connect test accounts** for driver payouts.
3. Add **expiration countdown UI** (already partly in place).
4. Store data in **Neon Postgres** so history persists.
5. Add **Map + driver markers** using Google Maps API.

If you want, I can group these into a **priority roadmap** — “quick wins (1 week) → quality of life (1 month) → advanced intelligence (3 months)” — so your team knows what to implement first for the biggest payoff. Would you like that next?
