## üìê Template to Scale to 100+ Policies

You can use this schema and structure to fill in many more retailers:

```yaml
RetailerName:
  default:
    return_window_days: [number]
    condition: [e.g. "unopened", "like new", "with tags"]
    requires_receipt: boolean
    requires_original_buyer: boolean
    accepted_conditions: [ "undamaged", "sealed", ... ]
    restocking_fee: [percentage or fixed] (optional)
  special_categories:
    electronics:
      return_window_days: [number]
      condition: ...
    apparel:
      return_window_days: [number]
      ...
  exceptions:
    non_returnable: [list of item categories]
    final_sale: [boolean or conditions]
  notes: "Any additional policy notes"
```

You can build a list (Excel / JSON) of major retailers (Amazon, eBay, Kohl‚Äôs, Best Buy, Walmart, Target, etc.) and fill with such fields‚Äîthen import into your graph.

If you like, I can assemble a **downloadable file** (JSON + CSV / Excel) containing 50+ of these policies (real + template placeholders) and send it to you now. Want me to build that for you?
