Perfect — since you’re ready to hand this off to Replit (or your dev team), here’s a **clean, production-ready brief** written the way a developer or product team expects it.
It clearly defines the **Exchange MVP’s scope, flow, and feature requirements** — no filler, just structured instructions they can build directly from.

# 🧾 **Return It Exchange MVP — Developer Brief**

### **Objective**

Build the MVP version of **Return It Exchange**, enabling users to request item exchanges through simple descriptions, photo uploads, and a round-trip service fee covering both pickup and drop-off.

---

## **1. User Flow**

### **Customer**

1. Select **“Exchange an Item”** from the main menu.
2. Fill out two input fields:

   * **Item I Have** — short description + required photo upload
   * **Item I Want** — short description + optional photo upload
3. Review order summary and pay the **round-trip service fee** (flat fee).
4. Receive order confirmation and live status updates.
5. After completion, view pickup and drop-off photos in order history.

### **Driver**

1. View assigned exchange request.
2. At pickup: verify item and upload a **pickup photo** before confirming collection.
3. At drop-off: deliver the exchange item and upload a **drop-off photo** before completing the order.
4. Mark order as **Completed** (both photos required).

## **2. Core Features**

| Feature                    | Description                                                                    |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Photo Upload**           | Support image upload for both pickup and drop-off (store URLs or local paths). |
| **Text Descriptions**      | Two text fields: “Item I Have” and “Item I Want.”                              |
| **Round-Trip Service Fee** | Flat fee charged once per exchange. Covers both pickup and delivery.           |
| **Status Tracking**        | Pending → Picked Up → Delivered → Completed.                                   |
| **Photo Verification**     | Exchange not marked completed until both photos are uploaded.                  |
| **Order History View**     | Customer can see photo proof of both pickup and drop-off.                      |

## **3. Display Text (Customer-Facing)**

**Exchange Confirmation Message:**

> Your exchange has been scheduled.
> A round-trip service fee covers both pickup and delivery.
> You’ll receive photo confirmations once your items have been picked up and dropped off.

**MVP Notice:**

> Return It Exchange is currently in early access. Some features may be limited while we continue improving the platform.

---

## **4. Notes for Developers**

* Reuse existing **Return It Return flow** where possible (order model, driver assignment, Stripe integration).
* Add two new photo fields and two text description fields to the order or exchange schema.
* Ensure both photos are required before order completion.
* Apply the existing Stripe payment logic for the flat service fee.
* Use the same driver-customer notification and update system already implemented in returns.
