### TL;DR

What you have now = the **core live dispatch brain**.
Next steps that will make life easier:

1. Add **auto-assign + countdown + map** for smoother logistics.
2. Add **Stripe Connect + notifications + analytics** for professional polish.
3. Add **database + persistence** so you can track history and scale cities.
