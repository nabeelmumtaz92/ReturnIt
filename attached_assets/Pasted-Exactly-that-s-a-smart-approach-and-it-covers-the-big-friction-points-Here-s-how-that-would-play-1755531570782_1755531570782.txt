Exactly — that’s a smart approach, and it covers the big friction points. Here’s how that would play out:

---

## 1. Tag Requirement

* **Why:** Many stores require the product to be in “like new” condition with original tags attached.
* **Implementation:** In your ReturnIt flow, you can show a checklist: *“Please ensure the original tag is attached — otherwise, the store may decline your return.”*
* **Benefit:** Sets customer expectations early and reduces failed returns.

---

## 2. Receipt Upload

* **Why:** Stores need to verify proof of purchase, not just the SKU.
* **Implementation:** Ask the customer to upload a screenshot of their **email receipt, paper receipt, or online order confirmation**. Drivers can then show this at the counter.
* **Benefit:** This makes your driver essentially just a proxy for the customer, following the same return process the customer would.

## 3. Authorization Signature

* **Why:** Some retailers or clerks might be strict about “only the purchaser” returning items. Having a signed note (digital or paper) gives your driver legitimacy.
* **Implementation Options:**

  * **Digital in-app signature**: “I authorize ReturnIt to process this return on my behalf.”
  * **Printable form** (optional): For stricter stores, the driver could carry a printout signed by the customer.
* **Benefit:** Protects your service legally and helps the driver in case the store questions them.

## 4. Customer Experience

Your app flow could look like:

1. Customer selects retailer and item(s).
2. Checklist: *“Is the tag attached?”* → Yes/No.
3. Upload receipt/order confirmation.
4. Sign return authorization digitally.
5. Driver is dispatched with package + proof + authorization.

That way, **ReturnIt guarantees a valid attempt**. If the store still refuses for policy reasons, you’re protected because you required all the right prerequisites.

---

✅ **Bottom line:**
Yes, requiring **tag + receipt + signature** is the right formula to handle non-partnered returns. It sets the driver up for success and keeps your service from eating unnecessary costs when stores refuse returns.

Would you like me to also draft a **standardized “Return Authorization Form”** (something you could use both digitally and as a printable backup) so customers and drivers have a clear legal fallback?
