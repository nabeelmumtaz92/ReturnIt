✖ Check for common project setup issues
The .expo directory is not ignored by Git. It contains machine-specific device history and development server settings and should not be committed.
Advice:
Add ".expo/" to your .gitignore to avoid committing local Expo state.
✖ Check Expo config (app.json/ app.config.js) schema
Error validating fields in /home/expo/workingdir/build/mobile-apps/returnit-customer/app.json:
 should NOT have additional property 'privacy'.
Advice:
Resolve schema errors in your app config. Learn more: https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/configuration/
✖ Check that native modules use compatible support package versions for installed Expo SDK

✖ Check for app config fields that may not be synced in a non-CNG project
This project contains native project folders but also has native configuration properties in app.json, indicating it is configured to use Prebuild. When the android/ios folders are present, EAS Build will not sync the following properties: orientation, icon, userInterfaceStyle, splash, ios, android, plugins, scheme. 
Advice:
Add '/android' to your .gitignore file if you intend to use CNG / Prebuild. Learn more: https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/prebuild/#usage-with-eas-build
