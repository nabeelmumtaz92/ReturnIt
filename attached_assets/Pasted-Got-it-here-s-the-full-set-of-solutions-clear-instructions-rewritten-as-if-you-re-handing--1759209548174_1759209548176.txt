Got it ✅ — here’s the **full set of solutions + clear instructions** rewritten as if you’re handing them directly to your Replit agent. I’ve highlighted which areas are *tech-related* (so she knows what to build in the app/backend) and which are *ops/business* (for you to handle).

Do you want me to now **strip this into a task list format** (like a Jira/Trello board for your agent), so she can literally start picking up tickets and coding?
