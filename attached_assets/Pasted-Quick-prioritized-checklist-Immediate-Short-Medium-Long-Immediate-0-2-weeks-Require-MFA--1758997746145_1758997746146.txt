Quick prioritized checklist (Immediate → Short → Medium → Long)

Immediate (0–2 weeks)

Require MFA for all admin / ops accounts.

Enforce least privilege IAM (remove unused keys; don’t use root account).

Turn on basic monitoring & error tracking (Sentry or similar) and create alerts for high-error rates.

Use HTTPS everywhere (TLS 1.2/1.3) and HSTS.

Don’t store card data — use a PCI provider (Stripe/Adyen) and use tokenization.

Add rate limits on public APIs and auth endpoints.

Add webhook signing and replay protection.

Sanitize and validate all user input; use prepared statements / parameterized queries.

Add health-check endpoints and set service restart policies.

Short (2–8 weeks)

Centralize secrets in a manager (AWS Secrets Manager / Vault). Rotate keys.

Set up automated dependency scanning (Dependabot, Snyk) and apply urgent patches.

Implement RBAC for app roles and admin UI.

Enable logging centralization (structured logs) and an alerting rule for spikes and anomalies.

Implement backups with encryption and test restores.

Add Content Security Policy (CSP), secure cookies, CORS policy and CSRF tokens for forms.

Harden mobile apps: secure storage (Keychain/Keystore), certificate pinning, tamper/root detection.

Medium (2–6 months)

Add WAF + DDoS protection (Cloudflare/AWS WAF + Shield).

Automate security tests in CI: SAST + DAST + container scanning.

Build an Incident Response Runbook + on-call rotation.

Implement idempotency for critical endpoints (payments/webhooks) and retries with exponential backoff.

Canary / blue-green deploys and feature flags for safer rollouts.

Perform a penetration test (external/3rd party).

Add database row-level encryption for very sensitive columns (SSNs/TINs).

Long (6+ months / ongoing)

Bug bounty program + continuous pen testing cadence.

SIEM (Splunk/ELK/Datadog Security) and IDS/IPS monitoring.

Achieve PCI scope reduction and compliance; GDPR/CCPA readiness if you have EEA/CA users.

Threat modeling and adversary simulation (red team / chaos testing).

Harden supply chain: sign container images, provenance, lock build pipelines.

Reliability / Crash-resilience (how to avoid outages & recover quickly)

Graceful degradation

If a dependency fails (e.g., search, payments), degrade functionality but keep critical flows online (e.g., accept orders offline, queue for later).

Circuit breakers & bulkheads

Protect services from cascading failures by failing fast for overloaded downstream services.

Queueing & backpressure

Use message queues (SQS/Kafka/Rabbit) for async work (notifications, retries, webhooks). Don’t block user flows on slow external calls.

Autoscaling + resource limits

Horizontal autoscaling + CPU/memory limits and pod eviction policies to prevent noisy neighbor crashes.

Blue/Green or Canary deployments

Reduce deployment risk — rollback quickly on errors.

Health checks & self-healing

Liveness/readiness probes (K8s) trigger restarts before catastrophic failure.

Circuit Breaker example

If payments gateway is failing > X% for 30s, stop direct calls, queue them and notify ops.

Backups & tested restores

Daily backups, test restore quarterly. Document RTO/RPO targets.

Observability

Instrument metrics (Prometheus), logs, traces (OpenTelemetry). Alert on error rate, latency, queue backlog, DB connections.

Security (how to prevent hacks & data loss)
Authentication & Authorization

MFA mandatory for admin.

Use OAuth2 / OpenID Connect and SSO for corporate users.

RBAC + least privilege for all systems (DB, S3, APIs).

Short-lived credentials and rotate keys automatically.

API & Web Security

Rate limiting per IP/key and per-route throttles for abusive endpoints.

Input validation & parameterized queries — eliminate SQL injection risk.

Output encoding & CSP — prevent XSS.

CSRF tokens for session-based flows; prefer token-based auth for APIs.

Secure headers: HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options.

CORS allowlist, not *.

Session security: secure, httpOnly cookies; session expiration and revocation.

Payments & Sensitive Data

Don’t store card numbers — use a PCI-compliant processor and tokenization.

Encrypt PII at rest (AES-256). Mask sensitive fields in logs.

Minimize PII retention — only store what you actually need.

Secrets & Configuration

Store secrets in a vault, not in repo or environment variables in plaintext. Use KMS/HSM for keys.

Enforce secrets scanning in CI (trufflehog, git-secrets).

Webhooks & Integrations

Sign payloads (HMAC with secret). Verify signature server-side.

Replay protection: include timestamp + unique event id; reject old events.

Idempotency keys: avoid duplicate processing on retries.

IP allowlisting option for merchant endpoints if they request it.

Example webhook verification (pseudo)
// server receives payload & headers
const signature = req.headers['x-returnit-signature']
const timestamp = req.headers['x-returnit-timestamp']
const body = req.rawBody
const expected = HMAC_SHA256(signingSecret, timestamp + '.' + body)
if (!safeCompare(signature, expected)) reject()

Infrastructure Security

Network segmentation: private DB subnets; only app servers access DB.

WAF + DDoS protection (Cloudflare/AWS WAF).

Egress restrictions and VPC endpoints for S3, RDS.

IAM least privilege for services and ops roles.

Mobile App Specific

Secure storage: Android Keystore / iOS Keychain for tokens.

Certificate pinning to prevent MITM (tradeoffs: updates).

Detect rooted/jailbroken devices and limit functionality or warn users.

Code obfuscation and tamper detection (minimize reconnaissance).

In-app update flow — force critical security updates.

Don’t log tokens/PII to app logs; redact before sending to crash tracker.

DevOps & CI/CD Security

Sign builds and container images.

Enforce branch protections, PR reviews, and 2FA for repo access.

Run SAST/DAST in CI; block merge on high severity.

Use immutable artifacts — don’t rebuild images on deploy.

Data & Logging Practices

Mask PII in logs (names/addresses/tokenized).

Separate audit logs from application logs and protect access.

Time-limited access for support to PII (just-in-time access with approval).

Monitoring & Response

Alerts for: unusual spike in failed logins, new admin user creation, high error rates, high egress, huge DB query times.

Maintain a contact list, status page, and communication templates for incidents.

Regularly review logs for anomalous behavior (automated via SIEM).

Incident Response & Recovery (must have)

IR Runbook: clear steps for detection → containment → eradication → recovery → post-mortem.

On-call rota and pager escalation.

Public status page to inform customers during incidents.

Forensic snapshots (immutable logs) before wiping compromised machines.

Breach notification process in line with laws (GDPR/State laws).

Testing & Validation

Penetration tests at least annually; more often when new capabilities launch.

Red team / tabletop exercises to test IR.

Chaos testing (simulate service failures) to validate graceful degradation.

Load testing for peak shopping/holiday days.

Practical low-effort wins you can do this week

Turn on MFA for all accounts.

Add TLS to all endpoints and enable HSTS.

Add webhook signing + idempotency.

Start Sentry (or similar) and create a page-flood alert.

Add rate limits on auth and payments endpoints.

Turn on Dependabot or automated dependency scanning.
