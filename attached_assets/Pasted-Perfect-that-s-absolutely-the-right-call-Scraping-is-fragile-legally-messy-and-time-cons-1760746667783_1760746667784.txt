Perfect ‚úÖ ‚Äî that‚Äôs absolutely the **right call**.
Scraping is fragile, legally messy, and time-consuming ‚Äî whereas **affiliate and partner APIs** are *stable, structured, and designed for automation*.

Let‚Äôs walk through how you can build your **Offer Engine entirely around APIs**, no scraping needed üëá

---

## üß© 1Ô∏è‚É£ Core Idea: ‚ÄúAPI-Driven Offer Feed‚Äù

Instead of scraping websites, Return It becomes a **data consumer** of existing affiliate networks and partner APIs.

Every few hours, your system:

1. Pulls the latest offers/coupons via official APIs.
2. Normalizes them into your database.
3. Links each to brands, categories, and cities (for your matching logic).
4. Marks old ones expired automatically (based on `valid_to`).

‚Üí Always fresh, no scraping headaches.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 2Ô∏è‚É£ How It Works Technically

### Step 1: Connect to Affiliate APIs

Start with networks that aggregate thousands of retailers:

| Network                      | Example Brands                | API Docs                                                                               | Notes                            |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Impact**                   | Nike, Adidas, Target, Walmart | [Impact API Docs](https://developer.impact.com/documentation)                          | Great reporting + coupon feed    |
| **Rakuten Advertising**      | Macy‚Äôs, Best Buy, H&M         | [Rakuten API](https://rakutenadvertising.com/publishers/)                              | Many fashion & retail partners   |
| **CJ (Commission Junction)** | Overstock, eBay, Kohl‚Äôs       | [CJ API Docs](https://developers.cj.com/)                                              | Very mature ecosystem            |
| **Awin**                     | Etsy, HP, AliExpress          | [Awin API Docs](https://wiki.awin.com/index.php/API)                                   | Also includes ShareASale network |
| **Amazon Associates**        | Amazon.com                    | [Amazon Product Advertising API](https://webservices.amazon.com/paapi5/documentation/) | For Amazon store offers          |

üß† Each of these gives:

* Offer title & description
* Coupon code (if applicable)
* Deep link with affiliate tracking
* Start / end date
* Brand metadata
* Category & commission rate

---

### Step 2: Build Your **‚ÄúOffer Sync Worker‚Äù**

This is a background job (Node, Python, etc.) that:

1. Authenticates with API (token-based, usually OAuth or key).
2. Fetches new or updated offers.
3. Writes them into your database.
4. Disables expired ones.

**Example pseudo-flow:**

```js
for each network in connected_networks:
    offers = network.fetchOffers(lastSyncTimestamp)
    for offer in offers:
        normalized = mapToReturnItSchema(offer)
        db.upsertOffer(normalized)
```

Each run updates thousands of offers in minutes.

---

### Step 3: Normalize Data (Standard Schema)

You define your own internal structure ‚Äî simple, clean, and consistent:

| Field             | Source                  | Example                    |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `brand`           | Affiliate merchant name | Nike                       |
| `category`        | Merchant vertical       | Shoes                      |
| `offer_title`     | API feed                | ‚Äú10% Off Full Price Items‚Äù |
| `coupon_code`     | API feed                | RETURNIT10                 |
| `link`            | Affiliate deep link     | impact.com/deeplink/...    |
| `valid_from`      | API feed                | 2025-10-15                 |
| `valid_to`        | API feed                | 2025-12-31                 |
| `source_network`  | your internal tag       | impact                     |
| `commission_rate` | optional                | 8%                         |
| `active`          | computed                | true/false                 |

---

### Step 4: Offer Matching (What You Already Planned)

Now you apply your Offer Engine logic:

1. `brand` match ‚Üí strongest
2. `category` match ‚Üí fallback
3. `geo` match ‚Üí local if applicable

Example:

```js
SELECT * FROM offers 
WHERE brand='Nike' AND active=true 
ORDER BY valid_to DESC LIMIT 1;
```

Fallback query for `category='Shoes'` if no Nike offers exist.

---

### Step 5: Refresh Strategy

All major networks include **modified-since** filters so you can poll efficiently:

| Network | Update Method                                   | Typical Rate  |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Impact  | `GET /Promotions?UpdatedSince=`                 | Every 2‚Äì4 hrs |
| Awin    | `GET /publishers/{id}/programmes?updatedSince=` | Every 6 hrs   |
| CJ      | `GET /advertiser-lookup?modifiedSince=`         | Every 6 hrs   |

You can schedule each connector to sync every 3‚Äì6 hours and never miss a new coupon.

---

### Step 6: Monetization Tracking

Each API already encodes your affiliate ID in the URL ‚Äî that‚Äôs how you get paid automatically.

Example from Impact:

```
https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=YOUR_RETURNIT_ID&murl=https://www.nike.com
```

You‚Äôll see conversions inside each affiliate dashboard.

Later, you can centralize this by querying their **reporting APIs** to calculate Return It‚Äôs affiliate revenue automatically.

---

## üß† 3Ô∏è‚É£ Scaling into Direct Partnerships (Phase 2)

Once Return It shows strong engagement stats, you‚Äôll start signing **direct brand partnerships**.
At that point, brands can:

* Give you their **private API token** or **webhook** to push new promos directly.
* Set up **Return It dashboards** to upload exclusive deals not visible in public affiliate feeds.

That‚Äôs your real differentiator ‚Äî the data & behavior layer you own.
