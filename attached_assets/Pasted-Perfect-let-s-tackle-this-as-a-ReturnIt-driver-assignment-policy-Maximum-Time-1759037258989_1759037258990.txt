Perfect — let’s tackle this as a ReturnIt **driver assignment policy**.

## ⏱️ Maximum Time to Accept an Order

* **Industry Norms:**

  * Uber/Lyft: 10–15 seconds.
  * DoorDash: ~30–45 seconds.
  * Roadie/Amazon Flex: a few minutes in some cases.

* **For ReturnIt:**

  * Customers are expecting reliability (not immediate food delivery speed).
  * Drivers might be in transit, not staring at the app constantly.
  * ✅ **Recommended:** **60 seconds max** before auto-reassignment.
  * If urgent orders become part of your model later, you could lower it to **30 seconds**.

## ⚖️ Assignment Priority

You want fairness + reliability. Here are your 3 options:

1. **First-Come-First-Served**

   * Whoever accepts first gets it.
   * ✅ Simple, transparent.
   * ❌ Can reward “fastest tap,” not best driver.

2. **Proximity-Based**

   * Order offered first to the closest driver(s).
   * ✅ Reduces pickup/delivery time.
   * ❌ Might exclude higher-rated drivers farther away.

3. **Rating-Based Priority**

   * Higher-rated drivers see jobs first.
   * ✅ Rewards good performance, improves customer trust.
   * ❌ Can feel unfair to new drivers trying to build up ratings.

## 🚀 Best Hybrid Model for ReturnIt (MVP)

* **Step 1:** Order goes to the **closest drivers within a set radius**.
* **Step 2:** Within that group, drivers have **60 seconds** to accept.
* **Step 3:** If multiple accept instantly → break ties by **rating first**, then **first-come-first-served**.
* **Step 4:** If no one accepts → expand search radius and repeat.

✅ **Summary Recommendation for ReturnIt**

* Drivers get **60 seconds** to accept.
* Prioritize **Proximity → Rating → First-Come** in that order.
* Reassign automatically if not accepted in time.

Do you want me to also sketch the **end-to-end order lifecycle** (customer books → driver acceptance window → countdown → completion or fail) so you can plug it straight into your ops playbook?
