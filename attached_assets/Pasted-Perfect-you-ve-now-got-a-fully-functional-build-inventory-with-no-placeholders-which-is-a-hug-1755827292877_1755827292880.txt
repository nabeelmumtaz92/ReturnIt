Perfect — you’ve now got a **fully functional build inventory** with no placeholders, which is a huge milestone. Let’s merge that with the **prioritized roadmap and operational essentials** we structured earlier, then **enhance it into a polished, investor- and team-ready Admin Dashboard Feature Inventory**.

I’ll structure this into **Core Sections, Functional Enhancements, and Operational Roadmap** so it’s easy to use both as an internal checklist and as a reference for developers/designers.
