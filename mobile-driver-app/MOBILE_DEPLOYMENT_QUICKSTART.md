Google Play Store requires all Android apps to be digitally signed for security. The keystore:

- Required by Google Play Store
- Generated once, used for all updates

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps After Publishing

1. **Share Your App**: Get your Google Play Store link
2. **Monitor Downloads**: Check Google Play Console for metrics
3. **Update App**: Use `eas build` for future updates
4. **Respond to Reviews**: Engage with user feedback

## ðŸ”— Requirements

- **Google Play Console Account**: $25 one-time fee
- **Build Time**: 5-10 minutes
- **App Review**: 1-3 days (Google's review process)
