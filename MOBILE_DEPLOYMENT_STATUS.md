## ðŸ“± Current Mobile Experience

**What Users Get Today:**
1. Visit your ReturnIt website on mobile
2. Chrome offers "Add to Home Screen"
3. App installs like native application

## ðŸ’¡ Technical Analysis

The Expo build failures were likely due to:
- Complex project structure

The PWA approach bypasses these issues while providing excellent mobile experience.
