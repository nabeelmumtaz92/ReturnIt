# Recent Changes

**October 25, 2025 - Admin Dashboard Critical Bug Fixes**
- **Navigation Fix**: Replaced `setLocation()` with `window.history.replaceState()` in changeSection() to prevent component remounting
- **WebSocket Stability**: Converted state variables to refs (isManualDisconnect, connectionAttempts) in useAdminWebSocket to eliminate infinite dependency loops
- **Database Schema Sync**: Added missing columns to orders table (receipt_photo_url, receipt_verified_at, driver_verified_total, total_discrepancy, discrepancy_flagged, discrepancy_notes)
- **Variable Ordering Bug**: Fixed OrdersContent component crash by moving activeOrders/completedOrders definitions before functions that use them
- Result: All navigation buttons now work correctly, no component crashes, smooth section switching

**October 25, 2025 - Demo Login Privacy & Security**
- Removed demo login button from public login page for privacy
- Demo endpoint remains functional at `/api/auth/demo-login` for company presentations when needed

**October 24, 2025 - Admin Dashboard Navigation Fixes**
- Fixed critical JSX structure error in admin dashboard that prevented all navigation buttons from working (removed extra closing div tag in header section)
- Enhanced demo login security: Admin access now environment-gated (development only) via NODE_ENV check
- Added demo@returnit.demo to master admins allowlist for development testing
- Verified all 30+ admin dashboard content components are properly wired and functional

## Security & Compliance

### Multi-Layer Security Architecture
Return It implements a comprehensive 4-level security architecture to protect customer data and prevent unauthorized access:

**Level 1: Public Access (No Authentication)**
- Basic rate limiting on all endpoints
- Public tracking page with ZIP code verification requirement
- Input validation and sanitization

**Level 2: Authenticated Access (Session Required)**
- Secure session-based authentication with server-side storage
- Bcrypt password hashing (10 rounds)
- Role-based authorization (Customer, Driver, Admin)
- OAuth integration (Google, Facebook, Apple)
- Session cookies with sameSite and httpOnly flags

**Level 3: Sensitive Documents (Signed URLs)**
- HMAC-SHA256 signed URLs for receipts, invoices, and order details
- Token expiration (24-72 hours configurable)
- Resource-specific access tokens stored in database
- Prevents tampering and unauthorized sharing
- Automatic email delivery with secure links

**Level 4: Real-Time Tracking (Multi-Factor Verification)**
- Tracking number + ZIP code verification required
- Enhanced rate limiting (30 requests per 5 minutes)
- IP-based throttling for abuse prevention
- WebSocket authentication for live updates

### Enhanced Rate Limiting
- **Authentication endpoints**: 5 requests per 15 minutes
- **Registration**: 3 requests per hour
- **Payments**: 10 requests per minute
- **Tracking queries**: 30 requests per 5 minutes
- **Sensitive documents**: 20 requests per hour
- **IP throttling**: Automatic 1-hour block after 10 failed auth attempts
- **Admin endpoints**: 100 requests per 15 minutes

### Signed URL System

- **Token Format**: `{base64url-payload}.{base64url-signature}`
- **Expiration**: Configurable (default 72 hours)
- **Use Cases**: Order receipts, invoices, confirmation emails
- **Security**: Tamper-proof, resource-specific, user-bound (optional)
- **Endpoints**:
  - `/api/orders/:id/view?token=...` - Full order details
  - `/api/orders/:id/receipt?token=...` - Receipt information
  - `/api/orders/:id/invoice?token=...` - Invoice with line items

### Data Protection & Compliance
