## Recent Updates (October 2, 2025)

### Physical Gift Card Delivery System (COMPLETED)
- âœ… **New Feature**: Drivers can now handle retailer-issued physical gift cards (Target cards, Walmart cards, etc.)
- âœ… **Security**: Server-side fee validation prevents tampering - always charges exactly $3.99 for gift card delivery
- âœ… **No Double Reimbursement**: System enforces either Stripe refund OR gift card delivery (never both)
- âœ… **Customer Flow**: When retailer issues gift card, customer gets NO monetary refund + charged $3.99 delivery fee + receives physical card within 1-2 days
- âœ… **Removed**: Confusing "store credit" option that implied ReturnIt account balance (not implemented)
- âœ… **Database**: New fields track gift card delivery status (pending, in_transit, delivered) and fee payment
- âœ… **Audit Trail**: All gift card transactions logged with Stripe PaymentIntent IDs and admin notes

### Previous Updates
- âœ… **Critical Booking Flow Fixes**: Resolved complete retailer selection system failure that prevented order creation
  - Fixed DatabaseStorage missing all company-related methods (getCompany, getCompanies, getCompanyBySlug, createCompany, updateCompany, deleteCompany, getReturnPolicyByCompany, getCompanyLocations) - production database calls were failing while in-memory storage worked
  - Fixed API route ordering bug: moved `/api/companies/search` before `/api/companies/:id` to prevent "search" from being interpreted as an ID parameter causing "invalid input syntax for type integer: 'NaN'" errors
  - Fixed CompanySelector query parameter serialization: implemented custom queryFn to properly serialize `{q: searchQuery, category: selectedCategory}` into URL query string instead of `[object Object]`
  - Fixed CompanyLocation TypeScript interface schema mismatch: made id, city, state, zipCode, acceptsReturns optional to match simplified database structure (locations stored as `{name, address}` objects)
  - Fixed CompanySelector input value handling: changed from `selectedCompany?.name || searchQuery` to `isOpen ? searchQuery : (selectedCompany?.name || searchQuery)` to allow re-searching after selection
  - Auto-populated database with 8 St. Louis retailers (Best Buy, Dillard's, Macy's, Local Jones, Nordstrom Rack, Home Depot, CVS Pharmacy, Putt N' Around)
- âœ… **End-to-End Testing**: Successfully validated complete customer booking flow from retailer search through Step 3 (Pickup Preferences)
- ðŸ”´ **Known Issues**: 
  - Google Maps API address autocomplete requires configuration - fallback manual address entry functional
  - Server 500 error when fetching return policies (non-blocking, company selection still works)

## Previous Updates (October 1, 2025)
- âœ… **Email Infrastructure Upgrade**: Switched to ImprovMX for FREE email forwarding (support@returnit.online â†’ nabeelmumtaz92@gmail.com), updated ALL website emails from old returnly.com domain to support@returnit.online
- âœ… **Support System Integration**: Tawk.to live chat on all customer pages, Resend for outbound emails (contact form), professional email forwarding via ImprovMX
- âœ… **AI Assistant Knowledge Update**: Refreshed AI assistant with complete October 2025 platform knowledge including all integrations, features, and contact information
- âœ… **Admin Pricing Settings**: Added database-backed pricing configuration system allowing admins to modify base flat fee through admin dashboard (stored in app_settings table)
- âœ… **Order Submission Fix**: Fixed critical booking form bug where orders weren't being submitted - implemented handleStep4Submit function that constructs complete order payload and calls createOrderMutation
- âœ… **Retailer Logging**: Orders now capture and store retailer name, retailer location, and dropoff address for comprehensive reporting and analytics
- âœ… **Companies Table**: Created companies database table with auto-population logic for St. Louis area businesses (Target, Walmart, etc.)
- âœ… **Audit Logging**: Complete order lifecycle tracking with timestamps for all state changes
- âœ… **GDPR/CCPA Compliance**: Account deletion and data export functionality in account settings

## Mobile Deployment Status
ReturnIt mobile deployment features a fully functional Progressive Web App (PWA) with service worker, web manifest, and native-like mobile experience. Chrome automatically offers "Add to Home Screen" functionality, providing users with app-like access to all ReturnIt features. Alternative Expo-based native app deployment encountered prebuild configuration issues but PWA solution delivers professional mobile experience without app store complexity.

**Beta Testing Status**: EAS Update successfully deployed for Expo Go compatibility. PWA provides immediate beta testing capability for both customers and drivers without requiring DUNS number or app store approval. Mobile experience is fully functional and ready for immediate deployment.

**Production Strategy**: Unified PWA architecture serves all user roles (customers, drivers, admins) through single codebase with role-based access control. This approach provides superior operational efficiency, user experience, and technical advantages over separate applications. Long-term user distribution expected to split between PWA users (instant access) and app store users (traditional preference), with PWA-first strategy providing competitive advantages through faster updates and universal compatibility.
