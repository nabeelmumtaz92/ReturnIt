# Driver Completion Checklist Solution
**Tracking Actual Return Outcomes (Like Spark Delivery)**

---

## The Problem You Identified

**Current Gap:**
- Customer books a return with **intent** (refund/exchange/donation)
- If retailer refunds to "original payment method" → **ReturnIt has no visibility**
- We don't know if:
  - Retailer actually accepted the return
  - Customer will get refunded (and when)
  - Donation was accepted by charity
  - Store credit was issued

**Your Solution:**
Like Spark delivery app, driver completes a checklist at delivery to confirm **what actually happened**.
