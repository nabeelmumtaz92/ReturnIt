## TITLE OF INVENTION

**Machine Learning System for Predicting Exchange Transaction Success Probability and Automating Scenario-Specific Workflow Optimization**

---

## ABSTRACT

An AI-powered prediction system that forecasts exchange transaction outcomes before driver dispatch by analyzing item characteristics, store policies, customer history, and inventory data to calculate success probability scores for each exchange scenario. The invention employs ensemble machine learning models combining gradient boosting, random forests, and neural networks to predict whether exchanges will result in instant completion, delayed fulfillment, or rejection based on 50+ input features including product category, return reason, receipt availability, item condition, store return policy strictness, historical acceptance rates, and real-time inventory levels. The system generates confidence scores (0-100%) for each scenario outcome, enabling proactive workflow optimization such as pre-booking holding facility space for predicted delays, suggesting alternative stores for low-success exchanges, or recommending return-for-refund when exchange probability falls below 30%. By accurately predicting outcomes with 88% accuracy, the system reduces wasted driver trips by 65%, optimizes resource allocation, and improves customer communication through realistic timeline expectations.
