A comprehensive visual documentation system requiring drivers to capture photos at pickup (item collection proof), store drop-off (delivery confirmation showing return desk), and customer delivery (replacement handoff verification). The system uses AI image recognition to verify photo authenticity, detect location spoofing, validate timestamps, and ensure compliance with legal requirements, creating immutable audit trails that reduce disputes by 90%, protect drivers from false claims, and provide merchants with delivery confirmation, increasing trust and accountability across all parties.
