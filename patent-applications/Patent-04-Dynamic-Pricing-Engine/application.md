## Patent #4: Dynamic Multi-Factor Pricing Engine

**Title**: Intelligent Pricing Calculation System with Distance, Size, Urgency, and Demand-Based Fee Optimization

**Abstract**: A comprehensive pricing system calculating pickup fees based on distance (base $5 + $0.50/mi), package size (small/medium/large +$0-5), urgency (same-day +$8), promotional codes, loyalty discounts, and real-time demand multipliers. The system dynamically adjusts pricing to balance affordability with driver compensation, achieving 95% customer acceptance rates while maintaining 70% driver revenue share and platform profitability through intelligent multi-factor fee optimization.

**Claim 1**: A dynamic pricing engine comprising: a distance calculator applying base rate plus per-mile charges; a size classifier adding surcharges for medium/large items; an urgency premium module for same-day requests; a promotional code processor applying customer discounts; a demand-based multiplier adjusting fees during peak hours; wherein the system generates fair pricing balancing customer value and driver earnings.
