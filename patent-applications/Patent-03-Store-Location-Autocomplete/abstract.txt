A store selection system enabling customers to type store names and receive autocomplete suggestions with two options: "Any [Store] Location" for nearest-branch delivery, or specific addresses for precise routing. The system uses geographic APIs to find nearby branches, calculates distances in real-time, and allows drivers to deliver to the closest store, increasing convenience by 80% and reducing customer friction in the booking process.
