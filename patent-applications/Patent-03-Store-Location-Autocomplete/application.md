## Patent #3: Store Location Autocomplete with "Any Location" Logic

**Title**: Intelligent Store Location Search and Flexible Destination Routing System for Return Logistics

**Abstract**: A store selection system enabling customers to type store names and receive autocomplete suggestions with two options: "Any [Store] Location" for nearest-branch delivery, or specific addresses for precise routing. The system uses geographic APIs to find nearby branches, calculates distances in real-time, and allows drivers to deliver to the closest store, increasing convenience by 80% and reducing customer friction in the booking process.

**Claim 1**: A store location system comprising: an autocomplete search interface accepting store name input; a dual-option suggestion module displaying "Any Location" and specific addresses; a nearest-branch routing algorithm directing drivers to closest store when "Any" selected; a real-time distance calculator showing proximity to customer; wherein the system provides flexible destination selection increasing booking completion by 75%.
