ABSTRACT

A computerized system for optimizing driver assignment in on-demand logistics platforms through real-time multi-factor analysis. The system continuously monitors driver locations, trajectories, performance metrics, and order characteristics to dynamically assign delivery tasks with maximum efficiency. The invention employs predictive algorithms that consider current driver positions, projected movement patterns, traffic conditions, order urgency, driver availability status, and historical performance data to calculate optimal driver-order pairings in real-time. The system features automatic fallback reassignment mechanisms with exponential backoff timers, ensuring 90%+ assignment success rates even in high-demand scenarios. This innovation enables superior service quality through faster pickup times, reduced driver idle time, and optimized earnings distribution across the driver network, while maintaining customer satisfaction through reliable and predictable service delivery.
