## Patent #5: Real-Time GPS Tracking with WebSocket Architecture

**Title**: Live Driver Location Streaming and Customer Tracking Interface Using Persistent WebSocket Connections

**Abstract**: A real-time tracking system broadcasting driver GPS coordinates to customers every 3 seconds via WebSocket connections, displaying live position updates on interactive maps with ETA calculations and route visualization. The system maintains persistent connections with automatic reconnection, reduces latency to <100ms, and provides customers with Uber-like tracking experience showing exact driver location, estimated arrival time, and turn-by-turn progress, increasing customer satisfaction by 90% through transparency and predictability.

**Claim 1**: A GPS tracking system comprising: a WebSocket server maintaining persistent connections with driver mobile apps; a location broadcast module streaming GPS updates every 3 seconds; a customer interface displaying live driver position on interactive map; an ETA calculation engine updating arrival estimates in real-time; wherein the system provides sub-100ms latency tracking with 99.9% uptime.
