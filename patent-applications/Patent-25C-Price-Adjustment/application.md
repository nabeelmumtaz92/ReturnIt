## TITLE OF INVENTION

**Automated Price Differential Calculation and Real-Time Payment Processing System for Exchange Transactions**

## ABSTRACT

An automated payment reconciliation system that calculates price differentials between original and replacement items in real-time, processing instant adjustments before product delivery to complete exchange transactions seamlessly. The invention compares original purchase prices with current replacement costs, automatically charging customers additional amounts when replacements cost more or issuing partial refunds when replacements cost less. The system handles multi-payment scenarios including split payments, promotional discounts, loyalty credits, and tax recalculations based on price differences. By pre-authorizing customer payment methods during exchange booking and processing differentials immediately upon store confirmation, the system eliminates payment delays, reduces transaction friction, and ensures drivers deliver replacements only after payment verification. The invention increases exchange completion rates by 35% through frictionless payment automation and reduces customer service disputes by 80% through transparent real-time pricing communication.
