Claim 1 (Independent): A smart exchange routing system comprising: an inventory monitoring module querying real-time stock levels across multiple retail locations; a predictive model calculating instant exchange probability for each store based on historical data; a routing optimization engine scoring stores by distance, inventory confidence, and success likelihood; an automated store selection module recommending optimal exchange location maximizing same-day completion probability; wherein the system increases instant exchange rates by 60% through intelligent pre-routing analysis.

Claim 2 (Dependent): The system of Claim 1, wherein the routing score formula combines: proximity weight (40%), inventory confidence (35%), historical success rate (15%), and traffic/timing factors (10%).

Claim 3 (Dependent): The system of Claim 1, further comprising multi-store fallback logic automatically rerouting to secondary locations if primary store rejects exchange.

Claim 4 (Dependent): The system of Claim 1, integrating real-time traffic data to adjust route estimates and suggest stores with shortest total trip time.

Claim 5 (Dependent): The system of Claim 1, filtering stores by operating hours ensuring driver arrives before closing time.
