An intelligent routing system that optimizes store selection and driver paths for product exchange transactions by analyzing real-time inventory availability, distance calculations, historical exchange success rates, and multi-scenario outcome predictions. The invention employs machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of instant exchanges based on store inventory data, suggesting optimal retail locations that maximize same-day completion probability while minimizing total travel distance. The system calculates comprehensive routing scores considering driver location, customer proximity, store inventory confidence, traffic patterns, and store operating hours to recommend the highest-probability exchange path. By intelligently routing exchanges to stores most likely to have replacement items in stock, the system increases instant exchange rates by 60%, reduces average completion time by 45%, and improves driver earnings through efficient multi-stop route planning that eliminates failed exchange attempts requiring secondary trips.
