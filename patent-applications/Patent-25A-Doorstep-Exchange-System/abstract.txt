ABSTRACT

A revolutionary two-way logistics system that enables customers to exchange products directly from their doorstep without visiting retail stores. The invention provides a comprehensive exchange management platform where drivers collect original items from customers, transport them to retail locations for exchange processing, and deliver replacement items back to customersâ€”all in a single coordinated transaction. The system intelligently handles three distinct exchange scenarios: (1) instant exchanges where stores issue replacements immediately and drivers complete delivery in one trip, (2) delayed exchanges where stores accept items but replacement products require later pickup and separate delivery, and (3) rejected exchanges where stores decline the exchange and items are returned to customers or held at operator facilities pending resolution. The platform automates scenario detection, driver routing, payment reconciliation for price differentials, and multi-leg coordination, transforming traditional return-only services into comprehensive bidirectional delivery solutions that increase merchant retention, reduce refund rates, and generate dual revenue streams from both pickup and delivery fees.
