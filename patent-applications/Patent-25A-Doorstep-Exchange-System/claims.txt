PATENT CLAIMS

Claim 1 (Independent - System):
A doorstep-to-doorstep exchange logistics system, comprising: an exchange order module configured to receive customer requests specifying original items for return and desired replacement items; a driver coordination module configured to assign drivers to collect original items from customer doorsteps and transport to retail locations; a store interaction module configured to facilitate exchange authorization at retail locations through driver-mediated presentation; a scenario detection module configured to automatically identify three exchange outcomes: (1) instant exchange with immediate replacement issuance, (2) delayed exchange with replacement unavailable requiring holding and later delivery, (3) rejected exchange with item return to customer or holding facility; a payment reconciliation module configured to calculate and process price differentials between original and replacement items; a multi-leg routing module configured to coordinate sequential driver assignments for delayed exchanges requiring separate pickup and delivery trips; wherein the system enables complete product exchanges without customer store visits, generating dual revenue from pickup and delivery fees.

Claim 2 (Dependent - Three Scenarios):
The system of Claim 1, wherein: Scenario 1 (instant exchange) completes in single trip with driver delivering replacement to customer same day; Scenario 2 (delayed exchange) stores original item at operator holding facility until replacement available, then assigns new driver for delivery; Scenario 3 (rejected exchange) returns original item to customer immediately or holds pending customer decision; each scenario automatically detected based on store associate response.

Claim 3 (Dependent - Price Differential):
The system of Claim 1, wherein the payment reconciliation module: calculates difference between original item purchase price and replacement item current price; charges customer additional amount if replacement costs more; refunds customer difference if replacement costs less; processes payments automatically before replacement delivery; handles split payments across multiple payment methods.

Claim 4 (Dependent - Driver Interface):
The system of Claim 1, further comprising a mobile driver application displaying: exchange pickup instructions with original and replacement item details; store interaction prompts guiding exchange authorization process; three outcome buttons for instant/delayed/rejected scenarios; automated navigation to next destination based on scenario outcome; photo capture requirements for pickup, exchange, and delivery verification.

Claim 5 (Dependent - Holding Facility):
The system of Claim 1, wherein delayed and rejected exchanges utilize operator holding facilities configured to: receive items from drivers via barcode scanning; store items in organized shelving system; track expected replacement availability dates; charge daily holding fees ($2/day); release items to drivers when replacements ready or customer decides disposition.

Claim 6 (Independent - Method):
A method for facilitating doorstep product exchanges, comprising: receiving customer exchange request specifying original and replacement items; assigning driver to customer location for pickup; driver collecting original item and transporting to retail store; driver presenting item to store associate for exchange authorization; detecting one of three scenarios based on store response: instant exchange if replacement available immediately, delayed exchange if replacement requires ordering, rejected exchange if store denies exchange; routing driver to deliver replacement (instant), holding facility (delayed/rejected), or return to customer (rejected); processing price differential payments before final delivery; wherein the method eliminates customer store visits while completing exchanges through multi-scenario automation.

Claim 7 (Dependent - Instant Exchange Flow):
The method of Claim 6, wherein instant exchange scenario comprises: driver receiving replacement item from store associate on-the-spot; processing price differential payment immediately; driver navigating directly to customer for replacement delivery; completing exchange in 1-3 hours total; generating revenue from both pickup fee ($5-12) and delivery fee ($5-12).

Claim 8 (Dependent - Delayed Exchange Flow):
The method of Claim 6, wherein delayed exchange scenario comprises: store accepting original item but lacking replacement inventory; driver transporting item to holding facility; monitoring store inventory for replacement availability; assigning new driver when replacement ready; new driver collecting replacement from store and delivering to customer; charging pickup fee, holding fee ($2/day), and delivery fee for total revenue of $15-30.

Claim 9 (Dependent - Rejected Exchange Flow):
The method of Claim 6, wherein rejected exchange scenario comprises: store denying exchange due to policy violation or condition issues; presenting driver with three options: return item to customer immediately, send to holding facility pending customer decision, or dispose/donate with customer authorization; processing restocking fee ($5) if disposal selected; minimizing customer inconvenience through flexible handling.

Claim 10 (Independent - Mobile Interface):
A driver mobile application for exchange logistics, comprising: pickup screen displaying original item to collect and replacement item customer wants; store processing screen with buttons for instant/delayed/rejected outcomes; photo capture interface for pickup verification at customer, exchange verification at store, and delivery verification at final destination; automated navigation triggering to next destination based on scenario outcome; earnings display showing combined pickup and delivery fees for two-way transaction.

Claim 11 (Dependent - Store Guidance):
The mobile application of Claim 10, further displaying: store interaction instructions prompting driver to present as customer's authorized agent; order authorization details to show store associate; visual decision tree explaining three possible outcomes; customer contact button to resolve rejection issues in real-time; inventory availability prediction indicating likelihood of instant exchange.

Claim 12 (Dependent - Revenue Optimization):
The system of Claim 1, further comprising: analytics module tracking instant/delayed/rejected exchange rates by store and item type; optimization algorithm suggesting stores with highest instant exchange probability based on inventory data; pricing engine adjusting fees based on distance, urgency, and scenario complexity; driver earnings calculator ensuring 70% revenue share across multi-leg delayed exchanges.

Claim 13 (Dependent - Customer Communication):
The method of Claim 6, further comprising: sending real-time status notifications at each stage (pickup, store processing, delivery); displaying scenario-specific timelines (instant: 1-3 hours, delayed: 3-5 days, rejected: immediate); requesting customer decisions when exchanges rejected (return, hold, or dispose); providing photo documentation at each transaction point; showing price differential calculations before processing payment.

Claim 14 (Independent - Data Structure):
A non-transitory computer-readable medium storing instructions that, when executed, cause a processor to: maintain exchange order database linking original items, replacement items, pricing, and logistics; track exchange status through states: pending, driver_pickup, store_processing, instant_complete, delayed_holding, replacement_ready, replacement_delivered, rejected_returned, rejected_holding; coordinate driver assignments for multi-leg delayed exchanges; process price differential payments based on item value comparison; generate revenue reports separating pickup fees, delivery fees, holding fees, and restocking fees.

Claim 15 (Dependent - Inventory Integration):
The computer-readable medium of Claim 14, further configured to: query retail store inventory systems in real-time; predict exchange scenario before driver arrives based on replacement availability; suggest optimal stores balancing proximity and in-stock probability; monitor inventory updates for delayed exchanges awaiting replacements; automatically trigger delivery orders when replacements become available; update exchange completion estimates dynamically based on inventory changes.
