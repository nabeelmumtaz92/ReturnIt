ABSTRACT

An intelligent spatial clustering system that revolutionizes driver efficiency in on-demand logistics platforms by automatically detecting and visualizing nearby delivery orders for batch pickup optimization. The invention employs density-based spatial clustering algorithms (DBSCAN) combined with machine learning models to identify geographic clusters of pending orders, calculate optimal multi-stop routes, predict driver earnings per cluster, and present actionable batch suggestions through intuitive map visualizations. The system analyzes real-time order locations using Haversine distance calculations accounting for Earth's curvature, generates dynamic density heatmaps showing order concentration zones, and solves traveling salesman problem (TSP) approximations to sequence optimal pickup routes. By enabling drivers to accept and complete 3-5 orders in a single trip, the invention increases driver earnings by 40%, reduces delivery times by 30%, and improves platform efficiency through intelligent batch coordination, all presented through a consumer-friendly interface showing earnings potential and suggested routes at a glance.
