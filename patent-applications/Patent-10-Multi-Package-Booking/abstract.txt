An intelligent package consolidation system allowing customers to book multiple items for simultaneous pickup, automatically calculating combined pricing with bulk discounts (10-25% savings), optimizing driver load capacity, and sequencing pickups for maximum efficiency. The system handles 2-10 packages per order, applies tiered pricing discounts, validates driver vehicle capacity, and coordinates multi-room pickups at customer locations, increasing average order value by 60%, improving driver trip efficiency by 40%, and reducing per-item costs for customers by 20% through intelligent multi-package batching.
