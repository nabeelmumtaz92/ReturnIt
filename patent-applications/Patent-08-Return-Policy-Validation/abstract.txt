An automated policy enforcement system validating return eligibility before driver dispatch by checking store-specific rules including return windows (14-90 days), receipt requirements, condition standards, final sale restrictions, and restocking fees. The system maintains a database of 10,000+ merchant policies, automatically verifies eligibility during booking, prevents failed returns by 95%, and provides customers with real-time policy compliance feedback, reducing wasted driver trips and improving first-attempt success rates from 60% to 95%.
