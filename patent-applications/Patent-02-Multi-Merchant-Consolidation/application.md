**System and Method for Consolidated Multi-Store Return Pickup and Routing Optimization Across Multiple Retail Destinations**

## ABSTRACT

A logistics consolidation system enabling customers to return items from multiple retailers in a single pickup transaction, with drivers delivering packages to different store locations via optimized multi-stop routes. The invention allows customers to bundle returns from Amazon, Target, Walmart, and other retailers into one doorstep pickup, eliminating the need for separate trips to each store. The system employs traveling salesman problem (TSP) algorithms to sequence store deliveries for minimum total distance, dynamically clusters returns by geographic proximity, and calculates consolidated pricing with bulk discounts for multi-merchant orders. By enabling 3-5 retailer returns in a single driver trip instead of separate pickups for each merchant, the invention reduces customer cost by 40%, increases driver earnings by 35% through efficient batching, and improves platform efficiency by consolidating routes. The system achieves 90% customer adoption for multi-merchant bundling and processes 10,000+ consolidated orders daily across major retail partners.
