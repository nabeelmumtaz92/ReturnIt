# ReturnIt Legal Compliance Guidelines

## Operating Without a Courier License

ReturnIt operates as a **facilitation service** that helps customers return items to stores. This model allows legal operation without a traditional courier license by following these key principles:

---

## Core Legal Framework

### 1. Agent-Principal Relationship
- **ReturnIt acts as the customer's agent** - not as a courier or shipping company
- Customers retain ownership and control of their items throughout the process
- Drivers are facilitators helping customers complete their returns
- All actions are performed on behalf of the customer, not the store

### 2. Public Service Only
- Returns are completed at the **store's public return desk**
- No privileged access or special relationships with retailers
- Same process any customer would follow in person
- No representation as store employees or authorized agents

---

## Operational Requirements

### 1. Proof of Purchase Documentation ‚úÖ

**Already Implemented:**
- Receipt upload required in booking flow
- Order confirmation accepted for online purchases
- Store receipt accepted for in-store purchases
- Files stored securely and accessible to drivers

**Driver Requirements:**
- Always verify proof of purchase exists before accepting job
- Ensure receipt is visible/available for store presentation
- Never proceed without valid proof of purchase

---

### 2. Clear Agency Disclosure ‚úÖ

**Customer Communication:**
- Terms of service clearly state ReturnIt is customer's agent
- Booking confirmation explains agency relationship
- Customers acknowledge they remain responsible for items

**Driver Training:**
- Always introduce yourself as representing the customer
- Example: "Hi, I'm here on behalf of [Customer Name] to return this item"
- Never say you work for the store or have special authority

**Store Interaction:**
- Present receipt/proof of purchase as provided by customer
- Follow standard public return process
- Accept store decisions on returns (refund/exchange/denial)

---

### 3. Drop-off Photo Verification ‚úÖ

**Already Implemented:**
- Photo capture required in driver app (CompleteDeliveryScreen.js)
- Photos stored as proof of service completion

**Enhanced Requirements:**
- **MUST photograph:**
  - Item(s) at store return desk
  - Store return desk signage (proves location)
  - Return receipt/documentation provided by store
  
- **Photo must show:**
  - Date/time stamp
  - Clear view of items and location
  - Any store-provided documentation

- **Photo serves as:**
  - Proof of delivery completion
  - Legal protection for driver and platform
  - Customer verification of service

**Implementation Notes:**
- Camera permission already configured in app.json
- PackageVerificationScreen.js handles photo capture
- Photos stored with order records for audit trail

---

### 4. Professional Conduct Standards

**Driver Behavior:**
- ‚úÖ Present valid photo ID if requested by store
- ‚úÖ Be courteous and professional at all times
- ‚úÖ Follow store policies and procedures
- ‚úÖ Accept store decisions without argument
- ‚ùå Never misrepresent role or authority
- ‚ùå Never claim to be store employee or representative
- ‚ùå Never demand special treatment or access
- ‚ùå Never argue with store staff decisions

**Prohibited Actions:**
- Entering employee-only areas
- Using store employee computers or systems
- Claiming partnership or contract with retailer
- Bypassing normal return procedures
- Accepting cash refunds on customer's behalf (store credit/exchange only)

---

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### 1. Customer Responsibility
- Customers acknowledge items may be refused by store
- ReturnIt guarantees delivery attempt, not acceptance
- Customers remain liable for item authenticity and condition
- Clear refund policy for refused returns

### 2. Store Relationship Management
- No exclusive agreements or partnerships claimed
- Respect store policies and staff authority
- Maintain professional distance
- Document all interactions via photos

### 3. Documentation Standards
- Receipt/proof of purchase: REQUIRED before job acceptance
- Drop-off photo: REQUIRED before job completion
- Store response: DOCUMENTED (accepted/refused/issues)
- Customer notification: IMMEDIATE upon completion

### 4. Dispute Resolution
- All disputes resolved as customer's agent
- Store decisions are final
- Customer may dispute directly with store if needed
- ReturnIt provides documentation to support customer claims
