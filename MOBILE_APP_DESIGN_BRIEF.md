## Brand Voice & Copywriting Guidelines

### Tone of Voice
- **Professional**: Enterprise-grade platform, not consumer app
- **Authoritative**: "Category leader", "infrastructure", "first platform"
- **Benefit-Focused**: Lead with value ("Earn $15-25/hour", "Track every step")
- **Concrete**: Real numbers, specific timelines, measurable outcomes
- **Customer-First**: "We handle everything", "Your schedule, your rules"

### Copywriting Patterns

**Headlines**: Action-oriented, benefit-driven
- ✅ "Returns Made Simple"
- ✅ "Earn $15-25/Hour"
- ❌ "Welcome to ReturnIt" (too generic)
- ❌ "About Our Platform" (not benefit-focused)

**Body Copy**: Clear, scannable, specific
- ✅ "Book a pickup in seconds. No more waiting in line or dealing with return labels."
- ✅ "70/30 split, size-based bonuses, and peak season multipliers."
- ❌ "We're a great platform for returns." (vague)
- ❌ "Join us today and see the difference!" (generic)

**CTAs**: Direct, action-oriented
- ✅ "Get Started"
- ✅ "Start Earning"
- ✅ "Submit Feedback"
- ❌ "Learn More" (too passive)
- ❌ "Click Here" (non-descriptive)

## Questions for Design Iteration

1. **Illustrations**: Would you prefer custom ReturnIt-branded illustrations or a premium stock illustration library (e.g., Storyset, unDraw)?

2. **Animation Complexity**: Should onboarding screens include subtle motion graphics (e.g., animated package moving on map) or static illustrations?

3. **Notification Sounds**: Should marking notifications as read/unread include haptic feedback or sound effects?

4. **Driver Rating Breakdown**: Should we include a "Tips to Improve" section with personalized suggestions based on low-rated categories?

5. **Feedback Form**: Should driver feedback include screenshot attachment capability for reporting app bugs?
