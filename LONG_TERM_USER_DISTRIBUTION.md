# ðŸ“Š Long-Term User Distribution Strategy

## Users Don't All Switch to App Stores

Many users actually prefer PWA over traditional app downloads, especially for business apps like ReturnIt.

## ðŸŽ¯ User Preferences Split Naturally

### PWA Users (Often Stay PWA):
- **Business users** who want instant access
- **Occasional users** who don't want app storage
- **Tech-savvy users** who prefer web-based apps
- **Users with storage constraints** on their devices
- **Quick access users** who value instant updates

### App Store Users (Traditional Preference):
- **Users who expect app store downloads**
- **Those wanting enhanced native features**
- **Users who like app store update control**
- **Brand trust through official app stores**
- **Users familiar with traditional app experience**
